### Used React Authentication

This health care website, we used react authentication from firebase. Our patients can easily taken services from this site, for this we added to contact part, login & register, Google signin part using react-authentication. Patient easily login this site & contact our Doctors.

### Used Private Route

We used this site private route & react authentication from firebase. In this website has two part Doctors & Blog. We used private route this two sections. Normaly you can not enter this two sections. If you want to enter doctors & blog Section , you need to login before enter this two sections.

### Features Of This Project

The used Api was entirely created by me. The data here are collected from Themeforst website & taken design ideas this site. The Services part will update dynamically if you wanted to show a single service information, click on service button showing details.This is completely responsive. As it was styled with bootstrap. This site was deployed on Netlify. The link is provided in the top. The only bug of this site is that you can hire a single developer multiple times in a single project. That is unrealistic.

### Used Resouces

In the project, we used: This was my first offical project on react-authentication & Second on React router.I used private route. React-authentication & private route used from Firebase. I used Bootstrap to style the whole project. Some Pure CSS was used in this project!

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
